## About Disney’s The Lion King

Be transported to the Serengeti plains with a Lion King theatre break to see the wonderful music and magic of the famous Disney Musical. Celebrating a staggering 16 years in London, the show is famous for its funky African rhythms, incredible puppetry and special effects that bring the jungle to life on stage.

## The Story

The Lion King begins with a huge musical celebration – born to the King of the Jungle Mufasa, Simba is the new hope and heir to his father’s throne. Not everyone is happy; Simba’s jealous Uncle Scar laments his lost chance to be king and plots to kill both Mufasa and Simba. As we watch Simba grow up – with a little help from his friends Timon and Pumbaa – he must finally decide whether to return to the kingdom and try to reclaim his rightful place as The Lion King.

## History of Disney’s The Lion King

Twenty years after the incredibly popular film, The Lion King lives on at London’s Lyceum Theatre. With a string of awards and an incredible soundtrack that is as fantastic as it is familiar, The Lion King is a huge hit with both audiences and critics, with over 75 million people worldwide having seen and fallen in love with this spectacular production.
