After a hit run on Broadway, Dreamgirls is currently playing to packed houses in London's West End.

## About Dreamgirls

The glamorous theatre show, Dreamgirls won six Tony Awards in its opening year on Broadway, and is now well established in London's West End. Directed by Tony-and Olivier-award-winning Broadway director, Casey Nicholaw, the show is set to be a big hit with an explosive soundtrack including hits like, 'I Am Changing', 'Listen' and 'Dreamgirls'.

## The Story

Set in 1960’s America, during the revolutionary era of R&B, Dreamgirls tells the tale of a girl group from Chicago called ‘The Dreams’. Competing in lots of competitions, the girls come across Curtis Taylor, an ex- car salesman who wants to be their manager, and although the group finds initial success, rifts form in the band as Curtis tries to replace the current lead singer, Effie, with her best friend, Deena.

## History of Dreamgirls

Opening on Broadway in 1981, the show was directed by Michael Bennett and starred Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jennifer Holiday and Loretta Devine as the three ‘Dreamgirls’. In 2006, the hit musical was adapted into a film starring Beyonce Knowles as Deena and Jennifer Hudson as Effie. The film won three Golden Globes and two Oscars, as well as winning supporting actress Hudson an Academy Award.
